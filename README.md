Sentiment Analysis Program 
The objective of my final Capstone project during my training at HyperionDev was to design a Python program to perform sentiment analysis on a designated dataset of Amazon text-based product reviews using spaCy and TextBlob by:
    Loading the spaCy model in English.
    Preprocessing the text data by removing stopwords and performing basic text cleaning.
    Creating a function for sentiment analysis that uses the spaCy model and TextBlob to determine sentiment polarity.
    Testing the sentiment analysis function on sample product reviews and comparing the similarity of two product reviews
